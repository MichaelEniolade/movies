<h3>How to implement the application on your personal computer:</h3>

1. Download the contents of the repository. You can do this by going to the following URL and clicking 'Download ZIP': https://github.com/MichaelEniolade/movies.git

2. Extract the files from the Zip file to a singular folder on your computer.

3. Open movies.py to customize the website with your favorite movies.

4. You can also customize media.py with your own attributes for movies. E.g. You could include the movie's screenplay writer. If you do this, make sure you also update the create_movies_title_content method in fresh_tomatoes.py with your new attributes.

5. Save any changes you've made to the files.

6. Delete the fresh_tomatoes.html,fresh_tomatoes.pyc and media.pyc  file

7. Open movies.py and run through a compiler to generate a new fresh_tomatoes.html file.

8. Open the HTML file using your web browser and you're done!
